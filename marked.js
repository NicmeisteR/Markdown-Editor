* Logistic Company (DHL)

Just a few months after Neil Armstrong took the first step on the moon, Adrian Dalsey, Larry Hillblom and Robert Lynn in San Francisco took a step destined to alter the global economy: In 1969, they founded the company DHL - the three letters stand for the initials of their last names.

Their new business idea formed the cornerstone for a globally operating enterprise. At first, the company founders personally transported cargo documents from San Francisco to Honolulu by plane. This made it possible to begin customs processing of a ship's cargo before the actual arrival of the shipment, thereby significantly reducing waiting times in the harbour.

DHL became a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Post in 2002. The Group is organized into four operating divisions: Post - eCommerce - Parcel, Express, Global Forwarding, Freight, and Supply Chain.
